# KumuluzEE JUL sample

> Build a REST service which utilizes the default logging implementation by java.util.logging to log basic information 
and pack it as a KumuluzEE microservice

The objective of this sample is to demonstrate how to use the default logging implementation by java.util.logging to 
log basic information. No additional dependencies are needed to enable simple logging.

## Requirements

In order to run this example you will need the following:

1. Java 8 (or newer), you can use any implementation:
    * If you have installed Java, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:
        
        ```
        java -version
        ```

2. Maven 3.2.1 (or newer):
    * If you have installed Maven, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:
        
        ```
        mvn -version
        ```
3. Git:
    * If you have installed Git, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:
    
        ```
        git --version
        ```
    

## Prerequisites

This sample does not contain any prerequisites and can be started on its own.

## Usage

The example uses maven to build and run the microservice.

1. Build the sample using maven:

    ```bash
    $ cd jul
    $ mvn clean package
    ```

2. Run the sample:
* Uber-jar:

    ```bash
    $ java -jar target/${project.build.finalName}.jar
    ```
    
    in Windows environemnt use the command
    ```batch
    java -jar target/${project.build.finalName}.jar
    ```

* Exploded:

    ```bash
    $ java -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* com.kumuluz.ee.EeApplication
    ```
    
    in Windows environment use the command
    ```batch
    java -cp target/classes;target/dependency/* com.kumuluz.ee.EeApplication
    ```
    
    
The application/service can be accessed on the following URL:
* JAX-RS REST resource - http://localhost:8080/v1/customers

To shut down the example simply stop the processes in the foreground.

## Tutorial
This tutorial will guide you through the steps required to use KumuluzEE Logs and pack the application as a KumuluzEE microservice. We will extend the existing [KumuluzEE JAX-RS REST sample](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-samples/tree/master/jax-rs).
Therefore, first complete the existing JAX-RS sample tutorial, or clone the JAX-RS sample code.

We will follow these steps:
* Complete the tutorial for [KumuluzEE JAX-RS REST sample](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-samples/tree/master/jax-rs) or clone the existing sample
* Configure java.util.logging configuration
* Build the microservice
* Run it

### Configure java.util.logging configuration

The default java.util.logging configuration can be overridden by providing the location of the custom configuration 
file with system property `-Djava.util.logging.config.file`.

In this sample in directory `resources` create file `logging.properties`: 

```
# Default global logging level
.level=INFO

# ConsoleHandler definition
handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# ConsoleHandler configuration settings
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=INFO
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
```

To use this configuration instead of the default one provide system property `-Djava.util.logging.config.file` when 
running the application:

```bash
$ java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=<path>/kumuluzee-samples/kumuluzee-logs-simple/src/main/resources/logging.properties -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* com.kumuluz.ee.EeApplication
```

in Windows environment use the command
```batch
java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=<path>/kumuluzee-samples/kumuluzee-logs-simple/src/main/resources/logging.properties -cp target/classes;target/dependency/* com.kumuluz.ee.EeApplication
```

and replace the `<path>` with appropriate directory path.

### Build the microservice and run it

To build the microservice and run the example, use the commands as described in previous sections.
